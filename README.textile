h1. DotNet Console

This project is intended to collect some of the helpers for console applications. The hope is that this will simplify the design of such programs.

h2. Goal

The goal is to be able to write code like:
someprogram.exe My Action --argument value
And hooking it up by writing something like:
static void Main(string[] args)
{
  ArgumentParser.Build()
                .Recognize(typeof(MyController))
                .Parse(args)
                .Invoke();
}
So that the class with the name My or MyController and the method with the name Action gets invoked.

h2. Example

Look at the Example project for the most resent example of how it is used.
